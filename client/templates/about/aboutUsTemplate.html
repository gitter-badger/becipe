					<h3>What is Becipe?</h3>

					<p>Becipe is an online community for people that are passionate about making their own healthy, natural skin care products.</p>
					<p>It's a place where experts share their experience and tips, where beginners can find out how to take their first steps and where everyone can benefit a shared resource of recipes, ingredients, tips and tricks.</p>

					<h3>Why did we start Becipe?</h3>

					<p>For a while now, we've been making our own creams, soaps and shampoos. We've learned from lots of great bloggers and writers.</p> 
					<p>But we noticed something.</p> 
					<p>While there are lots of really creative and crafty people in the do-it-yourself skin care space, there wasn't a home for people could connect and learn from each other about how to make wonderful, healthy products. We started Becipe because we think the community needs such a home and we're going to build it.</p>

					<h3>Who we are</h3> 
					
					<p>We're a collection of technologists and skin care experts that bring a unique combination of technology chops and passion for healthy living.</p>

					<h3>Join us</h3>

					<p>We could talk about the benefits of taking your skin care into your own hands.</p> 
					<p>But we'd much rather show you.</p> 
					<p>Or better yet, we'd much rather you show us!</p>  
					<p>So come on, lets get mixing. Together.</p>
